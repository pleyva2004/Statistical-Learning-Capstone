    "\n",
    "The Hazard Function, is defined as the probability that the subject will experience an event of interest within a small time interval, provided that the individual has survived until the beginning of that interval. It is the instantaneous rate calculated over a time period and this rate is considered constant. It can also be considered as the risk of experiencing the event of interest at time t. It is the number of subjects experiencing an event in the interval beginning at time t divided by the product of the number of subjects surviving at time t and interval width. Since the probability of a continuous random variable to equal a particular value is zero. That’s why we consider the probability of the event happening at a particular interval of time from T till  (T+ΔT)\n",
    " . Since our goal is to find the risk of an event and we don’t want the risk to get bigger as the time interval  ΔT\n",
